		<img src="social_media_examples.png" alt="Social Media Logos">
		<p>While mobile phones connect us through calls and texts, social media allows us to experience our friends and familys lives even if they live on the other side of the world.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Instagram allows us to share amazing photos</li>
			<li>Twitter lets us share great moments</li>
			<li>Snapchat allows us to communicate in a more interactive way</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Although there are problems sometimes (<a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/data-breaches/32023/facebook-hack-how-attackers-stole-the-personal-data-of-almost-30-million-users">Facebook hacks</a>) in general they help keep us in touch with loved ones and bring us together</p>
